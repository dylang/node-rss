### Add items to a feed

An item can be used for a blog entry, project update, log entry, etc.  Your RSS feed
an have any number of items. Most feeds use 20 or fewer items.

```js
feed.item(itemOptions);
```

#### itemOptions

 * `title` **string** Title of this particular item.
 * `description` **string** Content for the item.  Can contain html but link and image urls must be absolute path including hostname.
 * `url` **url string** Url to the item. This could be a blog entry.
 * `guid` **unique string** A unique string feed readers use to know if an item is new or has already been seen.
 If you use a guid never change it.  If you don't provide a guid then your item urls must
 be unique.
 * `categories` _optional_ **array of strings** If provided, each array item will be added as a category element
 * `author` _optional_  **string**  If included it is the name of the item's creator.
 If not provided the item author will be the same as the feed author.  This is typical
 except on multi-author blogs.
 * `date` **Date object or date string** The date and time of when the item was created.  Feed
 readers use this to determine the sort order. Some readers will also use it to determine
 if the content should be presented as unread.
 * `lat` _optional_ **number** The latitude coordinate of the item.
 * `long` _optional_ **number** The longitude coordinate of the item.

#### Feed XML

```js
var xml = feed.xml(indent);
```

This returns the XML as a string.

`indent` _optional_ **string** What to use as a tab. Defaults to no tabs (compressed).
 For example you can use `'\t'` for tab character, or `'  '` for two-space tabs.

## Example Usage

```js
var RSS = require('rss');

/* lets create an rss feed */
var feed = new RSS({
    title: 'title',
    description: 'description',
    feed_url: 'http://example.com/rss.xml',
    site_url: 'http://example.com',
    image_url: 'http://example.com/icon.png',
    docs: 'http://example.com/rss/docs.html',
    author: 'Dylan Greene',
    managingEditor: 'Dylan Greene',
    webMaster: 'Dylan Greene',
    copyright: '2013 Dylan Greene',
    language: 'en',
    categories: ['Category 1','Category 2','Category 3'],
    pubDate: 'May 20, 2012 04:00:00 GMT',
    ttl: '60'
});

/* loop over data and add to feed */
feed.item({
    title:  'item title',
    description: 'use this for the content. It can include html.',
    url: 'http://example.com/article4?this&that', // link to the item
    guid: '1123', // optional - defaults to url
    categories: ['Category 1','Category 2','Category 3','Category 4'], // optional - array of item categories
    author: 'Guest Author', // optional - defaults to feed author property
    date: 'May 27, 2012', // any format that js Date can parse.
    lat: 33.417974, //optional latitude field for GeoRSS
    long: -111.933231, //optional longitude field for GeoRSS
    enclosure: {url:'...', file:'path-to-file'} // optional enclosure
});

// cache the xml to send to clients
var xml = feed.xml();
```

## Tests

Tests included use Mocha. Use `npm test` to run the tests.

    $ npm test

## Notes
 * You do not need to escape anything. This module will escape characters when necessary.
 * This module is very fast but you might as well cache the output of xml() and serve
 it until something changes.

# History

I started this module over two years ago (April 2011) because there weren't any Node modules
for creating RSS. Besides these [25 modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/rss)
I would love to know what other projects are using it.

# Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. Feel free to fork and improve.
I do my best accept pull requests in a timely manor, especially when tests and updated docs
are included.
