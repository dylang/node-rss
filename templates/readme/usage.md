 * `url` **url string** Url to the item. This could be a blog entry.
 * `guid` **unique string** A unique string feed readers use to know if an item is new or has already been seen.
 If you use a guid never change it.  If you don't provide a guid then your item urls must
 be unique.

```

This returns the XML as a string.

`indent` _optional_ **boolean or string** What to use as a tab. Defaults to no tabs (compressed).
For example you can use `'\t'` for tab character, or `'  '` for two-space tabs. If you set it to
`true` it will use four spaces.
